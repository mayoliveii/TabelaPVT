# Tabela PVT
PVT table calculated from the implemented correlations numerically in Matlab software.

For oil phase: Saturation pressure; gas-oil solubility ratio; oil volume formation factor; oil compressibility; oil viscosity;
For the gas phase: Factor Z; gas density; gas volume formation factor; gas compressibility; gas viscosity.
